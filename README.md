# MK-ERVERS

### Word clarification:
- **M**: Minecraft
- **K**: Kotlin
- **ervers**: Servers sounds to basic :)

MK-ERVERS is my pitiful attempt to reimplement Minecraft Server. \
Do not ask, **emphasis on not**, why!

## Hermes: The messenger of the gods (proxy) that nobody needed.
## Hephaistos: The example of perfect architecture (subserver / not this software)
